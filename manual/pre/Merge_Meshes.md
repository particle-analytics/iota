# Merging multiple meshes
This feature allows users to merge multiple meshes into a single one (see [_Figure 32_](#Iota-Pre-Merge)):

1. Select two or more meshes from the list of meshes shown at the top left side of the window by clicking on their name. Alternatively, users can also select the meshes by using the selection mode on the [Views toolbar](/Views_toolbar.md) and clicking on the meshes rendered on the screen.
2. Introduce a value for the **Tolerance** to be taken into account for merging two meshes.
3. Click on ``Apply`` button.
