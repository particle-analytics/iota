#Scaling a mesh

Users can scale the dimensions of a mesh by using the ``Scale`` feature provided in the [pre-processing](/pre/pre_intro.md) module:

1. Select a mesh from the list of meshes shown at the top left side of the window by clicking on its name. Alternatively, users can also select the mesh by using the selection mode on the [Views toolbar](/Views_toolbar.md) and clicking on the mesh rendered on the screen.
* Introduce the settings to perform the scaling:
 * **Uniform Scaling**: if activated, the same scaling factor is applyied to all the directions.
 * **X**: value for the scaling factor in the direction of the X-axis.
 * **Y**: value for the scaling factor in the direction of the X-axis.
 * **Z**: value for the scaling factor in the direction of the X-axis.
3. Click on ``Apply`` button.
