## Gettting the Boundary of a Mesh

This feature allows users to extract the boundary mesh of an existing mesh:

1. Select a mesh from the list of meshes shown at the top left side of the window by clicking on its name. Alternatively, users can also select a mesh by using the selection mode on the [Views toolbar](/Views_toolbar.md) and clicking on the mesh rendered on the screen.
2. Introduce the target value in the ``Element Size`` field for the mesh discretization.
3. Click on ``Apply`` button.
