#Rotating a mesh

Users can rotate a mesh by using the ``Rotate`` feature provided in the [pre-processing](/pre/pre_intro.md) module:

1. Select a mesh from the list of meshes shown at the top left side of the window by clicking on its name. Alternatively, users can also select the mesh by using the selection mode on the [Views toolbar](/Views_toolbar.md) and clicking on the mesh rendered on the screen.
* Introduce the settings for the rotation:
 * **Axis**: users can choose between pre-defined (X-axis, Y-axis or Z-axis) or custom directions for rotation  axis.
 * **Point 1**: starting point to define the rotation axis (only applicable for Axis = Custom).
 * **Point 2**: end point to define the rotation axis (only applicable for Axis = Custom).
 * **Angle**: angle for the rotation in degrees.
 * **Create a copy**: if activated, a copy of the original mesh will be created.
3. Click on ``Apply`` button.
