#Input DEM data: EDEM 2017
The coarse-graining module of Iota supports reading directly the native files generated by EDEM 2017. Users just need to use the icon at the field named "EDEM" in order select the EDEM file with extension ".dem" of the simulation that they want to post-process (see _Figure 42_). Furthermore, users can define some reading options:  

* **Contacts**: if activated, the contacts data (particle-particle and particle-wall) is read.
* **Bonds**: it enables the reading of the data related to bonds present the simulation.
* **Geometries**: if activated, the geometries data is read.
* **Custom properties**: it enables the reading of custom properties defined by the user in EDEM.
