#Input DEM data: P4X
Users can define the files in P4X format that contain the simulation data to post-processed (see _Figure 43_):

* **Particles**: File containing the data related to the particles' properties (extension .p4p).
* **Contacts Particle-Particle**: File containing the data related to the particle-particle contacts' properties (extension .p4c).
* **Contacts Particle-Wall**: File containing the data related to the particle-wall contacts' properties (extension .p4w).
* **Geometry**: Files containing the data of the mesh or meshes that represent the geomtries/wall in the simulation (extension .p4s). 

A detailed description of the P4X format can be found here. Additional, since EDEM version 2.7, a "Particle Analytics Export" is included with EDEM in order to export the DEM simulation data in P4X format.
