#Importing a Mesh from a File 

Users can import meshes from files into the [coarse-granining](/coarse_graining/cg_setting_cg.md) module by clicking on ["Load Mesh"](/cg/cg_Loading_Mesh.md) button followed by selecting the option "Import from File". A pop-up window will be shown in order introduce the following fields for the mesh (see [_Figure 39_](#Iota-CG-Import-Mesh)):
* **Name**: users needs to provide a name for the mesh.
* **Description (optional)**: users can provide a description for the mesh.
* **Scenario (optional)**: users can associate the mesh to an existent scenario of the project. By default, the mesh is associated with the scenario that is currently loaded.
* **File**: the icon located at the right side opens a file browser window that allows users to select the mesh file to be imported.

The list of supported mesh formats can be found [here](/project/project_meshes.md).
